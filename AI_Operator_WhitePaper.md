# K8S AI OPERATOR

## Requirements - Human Readable Requests
- I’d like to write up an k8s AI operator on EKS and AKS, where I can create l CRs containing human readable text which tell the AI operator the request. The AI operator will integrate one or more actual AI backends and able to convert human requests to a set of operations and execute those operations.
- The human text request can be about interacting with cloud resources or k8s resources   Or troubleshooting something inside k8s cluster or the cloud.
- I want my operator to be flexible enough to work with all other AIs backends indiscriminately  so it can handles super sophisticated tasks in different fronts such as cloud resources, k8s resources operations, sre, security finding + remediations, and able to store request as conversations!  
- I’d like to add a common database on AWS but also accessible from Azure network that retains the history of the threads users talk to an AI operator in their k8s cluster so the operator in one cluster can look up at the threads IDs and content to find the possible resolutions that was done by other AI operators in the user cluster and either elaborate on specific threads or find the threads with satisfactory resolutions (rated by users) and perform similar work in current AI operator
- The AI Operator will be given access to it's dedicated repos where each requests once approved by the users can be created as a set of instruction stored in it thread id branch and thread ID folder. It can then create a new branch on those dedicated repos with same thread id, deployed local change to the cluster from those repos' branches. Once testing is completed and the user rate 100% satisfaction, it can then be submitted for PR reviews and merged by group of users on those repos as wells as the core instructions on its own repo.
- Provide the user interface with:
    - The ability to chat with the operator like human to human
    - The operator will suggest a set of actions to be performed and can answer questions
    - Only when the user agrees with the set of actions provided, the operator will will not execute any backend operations. Meaning the operator will continue presenting the resolutions or chat with the user until the user is approve the suggested operations
    - The workfload and set of actions must be provided
    - The user has the ability to rate the work by the operator
- Design me an AI that can be deployed on both EKS and AKS that do all of the above
- The operator must be able to design the workflow solution by working with multiple backend AIs for a complete resolution to be performed by the operator itself!

# Workflow
- User start human readable text chat with the cluster's AI Operator Controller via a GUI
- Always create workflows and specific details during suggestions with the users in the GUI
- Always include restore button for user to restore the state of resources prior to the chat in the GUI
- Always include user rating feature in the GUI for user to close out the chat if  the user 100% satisfied
- The Operator analyze user's requests, break it down to smaller components to see what exact backend resources needs to be interacted with by:
- - The operator looks into knowledge database for most relevant topics
- - - if found those potential backend resources, looked into what backend resources are to be interacted with 
- - - - look into AD groups or k8s roles that the user has access to. 
- - - - If any of the resources' permission is missing, prompt the user
- - - If not found, work with `backend integration & NLP` because  `backend integration & NLP` knows what backend resources to be worked on potentially
- - - Send alerts to admins for any anomalies or suspected behaviors if permissions validation failed.
- After validated fully with all those resources, box#2 will:
- - Look into the databases to see if same requests were made and resolutions were provided including box#20 user's preferences, history  stored there
- - - If found, propose similar resolution with appropriate info pertaining to cluster or cloud resources or whatever for the cluster
- - - If not found, come up with resolutions and propose it to user.
- - When user respond, repeats all above steps, actively do box#24 and/or box#15 to learn until the users are satisfied with the resolution proposed. 
- - Once user agrees with resolutions:
- - - Come up backup steps and commands involves and stored them in the database
- - - Do box#6 store improved knowledge into the database 
- - - Do box#7 to start creating feature branch with thread ID in the controller dedicated repos and whatever repos involved such as addon-repos, script repos, NLP repos
- - - Orchestrate the work and make logical sequences of calls to `Backend Integration & NLP`
- - - If needed to create resources/commands in the middle of the sequences that's beyond the NLP Engines or backends APIs, then the box#2 must come up with resources creation / commands to do so to ensure the whole logical sequences of calls of resolution is completed, including work on box#4
- - - Let Box#9 do the work independently
- - - Provide result and and stored in the database
- - - Present it to the user and ask the user to rate. If happy, create PRs via box#7
- - - If user is not happy, repeat the whole process starting with box#6
- - - - If user wants to restore initial state, perform restoration from backup to right before a chat with the user
- - - If user is happy meaning rating is 100% from user, create PRs

# Designs
- Comprehensive Design for a Multi-Platform AI Operator on EKS and AKS with Integrated Repositories, Knowledge Base, and Interactive User Interface
This design details the implementation of a sophisticated AI operator that can be deployed on both Amazon EKS and Azure AKS. It allows users to submit human-readable requests to manage cloud resources, Kubernetes operations, and more. The operator will leverage multiple AI backends for natural language processing, execute complex tasks, and maintain a shared knowledge base accessible across clusters. Additionally, it will integrate with version control systems to manage and track changes based on user requests and provide an interactive interface for user interaction and approval.
